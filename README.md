## Set Up
###### You should have node, npm, git, bower and gulp installed
1. Run `sudo npm init` and agree with all the configurations.
2. Run `sudo npm install` to install third-party dependency files.
3. Run `sudo npm-check-updates -u` or `sudo ncu -u` to update any old packages.
4. Run `sudo gulp build` to regenerate the css project's files.

## Tasks
